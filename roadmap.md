# SOCS Roadmap

The SOCS has been released in its **Alpha version** at **M10** as instance of DIHIWARE that is a result of an ongoing private research project under development at _ENGINEERING R&D Department_. This first version takes into account results of a survey sent to pilot leaders with the scope to understand the feeling that pilots have with respect to the use of the social digital space and to define the basic SOCS features.

Then the Alpha version was presented to pilots and WP7. Through WP7, DEMETER stakeholders were involved, through a series of workshop, in the definition of: a new SOCS design, the data models for the DEMETER SOCS entities and the first version of the co-creation application. Results of this interaction with WP7 will be taken into account in the development phase that will produce the SOCS **Beta version** at **M22** (including the new SOCS design and data model) and with the SOCS **Pre-final version** at **M28** (including the first version of the co-creation app).

A second iteration of workshops with SOCS users will aim at collecting feedback from them on the first version of the co-creation application. The workshop’s results will converge in the SOCS **Final version** that will be available at **M38** (D4.5 – Final Release and Support Report for Decision Enablers, Advisory Support Tools and DEMETER Stakeholder Open Collaboration Space) and will include a refinement of all SOCS services and the final version of the co-creation application.
